# What's this, then?

I'm learnin' Python.

What you see in this repository was my response to a task set as part of a software development course, which was intended more as a way to practice using git than it was as a Python task. Since I was already pretty comfy with the basics of git but hadn't written any Python in more than a decade, I took the ball and ran with it a bit.

The Python part of the instructions (see "task.md" for the whole thing) were extremely minimal:

>* Create a new file called guessing_game.py
>
>```
>touch guessing_game.py
>```
>* In the file, create a simple Python guessing game using:
>
>1. User Input
>2. If-Else statement

Since this was the first day of the first taught module of the course, other aspects of Python logic (e.g. loops) hadn't been covered yet. Although I had used some of that stuff in the distant past, I chose to limit myself to the tools provided by the course thus far, so this is just an unruly mess of if/elses and inputs; I might restructure later on, though, because I was thoroughly entertaining myself here.

What can I say? I'm easily amused.


# Instructions

To play, make sure you have Python 3 installed and run `python guessing_game.py` from the terminal. If this fails even with Python 3 installed, you might have an older version of Python installed as well (e.g. if running Mac OS), in which case you'll have to specify `python3`. This won't run in older versions without throwing up an error.
